This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Home Page
On the home page, you can 
1) see the list of popular movies
2) search a name and get the list of movies matching that criteria. 
3) Clicking on any of the movie Tiles on the home page will take you to the detailed page for that specific movie

## Movie Page
On the movie page, you can find all the details about movie like the storyline, budget, revenue, release date, cast etc.

## App structure
On the top, we have the components folder which has 2 folder
    -- App (Containing Routing details for the app)
    -- Misc (Containing all the other components)

## Out of Scope
Due to shortage of time, I have not been able to add testing and debouncing on the app home page.
