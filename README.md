You will also see any lint errors in the console.

On the home page, you can see the list of popular movies
You can also search any specific movie that you want to find details for
Clicking on any of the appTiles on the home page will take you to the home page for that specific movie

On the movie page, you can find all the details about movie like the storyline, budget, revenue, release date, cast etc.

## App structure
On the top, we have the components folder which has 2 folder
    -- App (Containing Routing details for the app)
    -- Misc (Containing all the other components)

## Out of Scope
Due to shortage of time, I have not been able to add testing and debouncing on the app home page.
